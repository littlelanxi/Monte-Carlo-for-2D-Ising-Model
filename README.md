### mc_on_2Dising.py
is the main program which contains Monte Carlo Simulation process and physical quantities of 2D Ising Model .

### polyfit.py
is a poly fit process that helps to find the critical exponents of 2D Ising model.

### error_n.py
calculates the errorbar respect to different N.( N is the length of Ising model )
